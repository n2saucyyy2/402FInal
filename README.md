# Reflection
This project was an exciting opportunity for our team to design and create an app that we all had a large interest in and could envision using regularly in 
our daily lives. Initially, our project idea was ambitious, with plans to implement features that would not only track exercises and lifts but also 
generate personalized workout routines. However, as the scope became clearer, we realized the importance of prioritizing quality over quantity and decided to 
our efforts on perfecting the exercise tracking component. The decision to streamline our goals was smart, allowing us to channel our energy into crafting a 
robust and user-friendly experience that we could genuinely see ourselves relying on almost every day.

Once we aligned on this revised vision, our progress accelerated, and we made significant headway. Of course, no project is without its challenges, and we encountered 
a few obstacles along the way. One particularly difficult issue involved persistent image data in the pipeline when creating or editing notes, which required us to identify
and address the underlying cause. While the fix itself was relatively straightforward, pinpointing the root of the bug proved more difficult than anticipated.

Despite these minor setbacks, the process of conceptualizing, designing, and ultimately bringing our app to life was largely satisfying. We were able to put into practice many of 
the skills and concepts we had acquired throughout the semester, such as implementing functional buttons, adding and deleting functionality, and enabling photo uploads from mobile devices.
The ability to apply this knowledge in a practical, hands-on manner was invaluable and made the task of creating a fully-functioning app from scratch significantly more manageable.
